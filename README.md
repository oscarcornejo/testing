# Test

## 1.- Create an app in React using the given API with the given requirements:

- Have a left sidebar with two buttons: New Post and List posts
- New Posts tab should:
- Be able to Create new posts with title, body and userId, to the API
- Validate fields as required, except the userId that is hidden.
- Show an error if the requirements are not met.
- List Posts tab should have:
- List all the users in the api (Eg: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)
- If a Post is clicked, it should send you to the post details page
- Post detail
- It should show all the info of the post (from the API)
  (Eg: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/2)

For the API you can use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

## Extra credit:

- Paginate the list of post with infinite scroll (5 posts per page)
- Use prebuilt components like material ui, bootstrap, etc.
